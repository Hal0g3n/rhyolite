## Inspiration
We looked at some of our friends computers and having more than twenty tabs open at once making the computer laggy and also making work inefficient as he often have to navigate through them

## What it does
Rhyolite groups tabs together, managing the amount of total tabs you have on screen at any one time.

## How we built it
Using a chrome extension, we used mainly javascript

## Challenges we ran into
It was also a difficulty trying to stay up and completing the project in such a limited amount of time that is given overnight.
The way extensions are coded makes it difficult to store and update data resulting in a large chain of bugs that took a long time to debug

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We Delivered all of the features we wanted to put in our final product and also add some extra features

## What we learned
We learnt how javascript worked in the field of developing browser extensions and the possibility it has to increase productivity
## What's next for Rhyolite
A system to organize workspaces and pin certain workspaces at the top
A way to customize the CSS for the extension to allow the use of other designs.
Having a profile system for further organization of workspaces
