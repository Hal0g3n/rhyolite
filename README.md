## Inspiration
We looked at some of our friends' computers and having more than 40 tabs open at once, making the computer very laggy and making work inefficient, as navigation through the tabs is not nice.

## What it does
Rhyolite groups tabs together and only keeps open one group at a time, managing the amount of total tabs you have on screen at any one time.

## How we built it
We used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make a chromium browser extension.

## Challenges we ran into
It was also a difficulty trying to stay up and completing the project in such a limited amount of time (overnight, 23½ hours)
The way chromium extensions are coded makes it not very nice to store and update data, resulting in an undesirablly long chain of bugs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We delivered all of the features we wanted to put in our final product, and also added some extra features!

## What we learned
We learnt how to develop browser extensions! We also realised the possibilities that browser extensions could increase productivity.

## What's next for Rhyolite
A system to organize workspaces and pin certain workspaces at the top
A way to customize the CSS for the extension to allow the use of other designs. (a bit done)
Having a profile system for further organization of workspaces.
